The United States Grand Prix on 19th October would have been a snoozefest if not for Lando Norris and Charles Leclerc's battle for the second step of the rostrum. It's a bit of a shame that my first "Non-Biased Power Rankings" post is being published after such an uneventful race, but such is life. 

First I'd like to recap how these results shall be interpreted because the numbers may seem a bit arcane at first. Let's take two examples: Max Verstappen and Lance Stroll. Max is the A+ student who always scores 95%+ on every exam. Lance is a solid C student. For Max it's more difficult to overperform the high expectations - he needs almost 100% to do that. So when we look at the rankings we have to keep in mind that these results show us how a driver performed compared **to himself**! 

So without further ado let's see the rankings for the US Grand Prix.
